# Features

## Implemented (Prototype)
- MVP: boot to a graybox arena with walk/jump movement
- In-game tuning overlay for gravity/movement values
- Runtime feature flags (air control, bunny hop, friction)
- Save/load tuning presets as JSON

## Planned (High-Level)
- Movement: coyote time, jump buffer, air control polish
- Camera: follow camera with collision avoidance and smoothing
- Levels: modular blocks, checkpoints, hazards, collectibles
- Game loop: main menu, pause, restart, level select
- Debug: in-game metrics (speed, jump height, split timing)

## Out of Scope (For Now)
- Multiplayer
- Networked features
- Modding pipeline
