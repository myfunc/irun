## Implemented (Prototype)
- MVP: boot to a simple 3D scene
- IVAN demo: first-person playable graybox with bhop/strafe-style movement prototype
- IVAN demo: in-game debug/admin panel with live movement parameter tuning
- IVAN demo: ledge-vault prototype (second-jump near ledge, with configurable boost and ledge height window)
- IVAN demo: generated test course with walls and jump obstacles
- IVAN demo: Dust2 Largo BSP-to-triangle asset pipeline and runtime map loading

## Planned (High-Level)
- Movement: walk/run, jump, coyote time, jump buffer, air control
- Movement: iterate wallrun/grapple from toggleable prototype hooks
- Camera: follow camera with collision avoidance and smoothing
- Levels: modular blocks, checkpoints, hazards, collectibles
- Game loop: main menu, pause, restart, level select
- Debug: in-game tweakables and metrics

## Out of Scope (For Now)
