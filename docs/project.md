# Project

## One-Liner
IRUN is a fast, readable 3D platformer focused on responsive movement and clear traversal challenges.

## Status
Prototype / initialization phase.

## Pillars
- Movement first: tight controls, predictable physics, forgiving camera.
- Readable levels: strong silhouettes, clear affordances, low ambiguity.
- Short iteration loop: fast to run, easy to tweak.

## Target (Initial)
- Platform: Desktop (macOS/Windows/Linux)
- Runtime: Python

## Constraints (Initial)
- Keep dependencies minimal and well-documented.
- Prefer deterministic gameplay rules over emergent physics chaos.
