# Project

## One-Liner
IRUN is a monorepo for the project; **MVP** is the main 3D platformer game app focused on responsive movement and clear traversal challenges.

## Status
Prototype / initialization phase.

## Pillars
- Movement first: tight controls, predictable physics, forgiving camera.
- Readable levels: strong silhouettes, clear affordances, low ambiguity.
- Short iteration loop: fast to run, easy to tweak.
- Tuning-friendly: in-game physics knobs and feature flags for rapid iteration.

## Target (Initial)
- Platform: Desktop (macOS/Windows/Linux)
- Runtime: Python

## Apps
- `apps/mvp`: MVP (game)

## Constraints (Initial)
- Keep dependencies minimal and well-documented.
- Prefer deterministic gameplay rules over emergent physics chaos.
